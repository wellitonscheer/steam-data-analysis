As Her Majesty's domain expands, we require a capable administrator to guide Her latest colonies to prosperity. We will provide you with ships, colonists, and other tools necessary to tame these wild, virgin lands, and turn them into a prosperous colonial enterprise, all under the Queen's watchful eye. Naturally, the Crown will expect you to share the bounty of these new lands, pay your taxes on time, and continue expanding the boundaries of Her Majesty’s colonial possessions. Obedience may earn you rewards,but refusing to pay your dues or worse, declaring independence, will have dire consequences. So, governor. Are you ready to colonize One More Island? You are called upon to explore the frontiers of Her Majesty’s colonial empire, claim territory, then exploit it to its fullest to gain riches for the throne! Set sail for the New World to plant Her flag and establish a new colony - as well as ensuring it thrives. Each exploration is never the same, thanks to a world map generated dynamically from a combination of hand-crafted map elements. Customize the challenge to your tastes, adjusting island size, land fertility, amount of natural resources and more, to make it as easy or as hard as desired. As governor, you're in charge. Plan out the colony, take care of your residents, and turn a small outpost into an overseas metropolis bustling with commerce! Construct the buildings you want: The freeform building designer allows fine-tuning workshop placement and colonist’s paths to optimize the holy colony plan. Look after the colonists' needs. Happy colonists work harder and faster, growing your, err, Her Majesty's colonial empire.

Explore the world, find new spots to establish more colonies, then tie them together into a self-sufficient network: An empire of your own making. Build a new fleet to explore the archipelago, claim new islands for your domain, then link them together with overseas trade routes. Optimize your production chains and increase their complexity to create entire industries independent of the Old World. Research new ways to develop your fledgling colony into a New World superpower. Each civilization tier brings with it new challenges, new requirements - and new opportunities. The Queen wants her share of New World's bounty. Taxes are expected, as is ordained. But there's always another option, one that your colonists might look upon favorably. Manage your reputation at the royal court. Pay your taxes on time and meet their expectations or...

After using this narcotic industrial chemical, he ruthlessly kills his whole family - his wife, 12-year-old daughter and newborn son – out of severe hallucination. It was only after he sobers up that he realizes what a disaster he has brought to himself. So, he decides to avenge those who were responsible for his decadence and for turning him into a human less worthy than an animal. Thus began the murders and the unimaginable violence! The recorded films during the murders and the heartbreaking confessions by the victims shock everyone and cause turbulence in the society. Faramarz Afshar, a 32-year-old detective, is assigned to investigate this case; a case which can seemingly be regarded as the most difficult challenge in his life.

Starring a little red man named Anton - Boiler City’s top exterminator - Antonball Deluxe Lite quite literally turns the breakout genre on its head, blending traditional brick-breaking gameplay with tight, intense platforming. Antonball Deluxe Lite features a free lite sampling of stages from Antonball Deluxe. 'Working on Antonball Deluxe has been a dream come true for the studio. Personally, I'm very excited to be working with Proponent toward the goal of making it acceptable for everyone to play with their balls,” says Tony Grayson, Studio Head at Summitsphere. Antonball Deluxe Lite includes three separate modes: ANTONBALL is an enhanced low-definition remake of Summitsphere’s legendary game jam title! After a long night on the town, Anton , Boiler City's resident exterminator and overconsumer of fizzy libation, is struggling to find his way back home from Brulo's Casino. Using his trusty Antonball, Anton decides to take the most direct path home after an unfortunate trip into the sewers: breaking straight through every single wall between the sewers and the city he calls home in 3 stages of brick-smashing fun! PUNCHBALL is the tale of Anton's building-mate Annie , and her indefatigable need to be the absolute best. When Annie discovers the Punchball Tourney being held at Brulo's Casino, with the grand prize being a lifetime supply of Ballble Tea, she sets out to win first place! You'll need to help her defeat all of the trickster beasts that have volunteered to take part in Brulo's wild game. Use the Punchball to slam enemies, then kick 'em off the stage! Do you have what it takes to be the Punchball Champion? VS. ANTONBALL is Antonball but competitive! Each team has their own brick wall and aims to break the other team's wall first. Defeat the other team by destroying their wall! Play 1v1, 2v2, or even 2v1 (if you're into that)! Many power-ups are in play, with some twists and turns depending on which arena you're having your ball-based blitz in! You can even pick some up and throw them! Brick-breakin', ball-bustin' gameplay with a platformin' twist! Includes THREE games: Antonball Lite, Punchball Lite, and VS. Antonball Lite! 7 levels of stimulating mole-mashin' action, handpicked from Antonball Deluxe! 5 different characters to unlock and play as!
